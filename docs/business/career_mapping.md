2. **Secondary Dimension Compatibility (25% weight)**
   - Support for user's 4th-6th ranked dimensions
   - Complementary skill utilization
   - Growth potential alignment

3. **Work Environment Fit (20% weight)**
   - Physical work setting preferences

## Matching Algorithm

### Multi-Stage Matching Process

#### Stage 1: Initial Compatibility Filtering
- Filter careers with RAISEC correlation â‰¥ 0.6
- Exclude careers with major misalignment (top dimension < 30)
- Consider user constraints (education, location, etc.)

#### Stage 2: Weighted Scoring Calculation

```python
def calculate_career_match_score(user_profile, career_profile):
    # RAISEC compatibility (40% weight)
    raisec_score = calculate_raisec_similarity(
        user_profile.raisec_scores, 
        career_profile.raisec_profile
    )
    
    # Preference alignment (25% weight)
    preference_score = calculate_preference_alignment(
        user_profile.preferences, 
        career_profile.characteristics
    )
    
    # Requirement feasibility (20% weight)
    feasibility_score = calculate_requirement_feasibility(
        user_profile.background, 
        career_profile.requirements
    )
    
    # Market factors (15% weight)
    market_score = calculate_market_attractiveness(
        career_profile.job_market,
        user_profile.location
    )
    
    # Weighted final score
    final_score = (
        raisec_score * 0.40 +
        preference_score * 0.25 +
        feasibility_score * 0.20 +
        market_score * 0.15
    )
    
    return min(100, max(0, final_score))
```

#### Stage 3: Personalization and Ranking
- Apply user-specific weightings
- Consider career stage and experience level
- Factor in geographic and cultural preferences
- Generate confidence intervals

### Similarity Calculation Methods

#### RAISEC Correlation Formula
```python
def calculate_raisec_similarity(user_scores, career_profile):
    """
    Calculate similarity using weighted Euclidean distance
    with normalization for score ranges.
    """
    dimensions = ['R', 'A', 'I', 'S', 'E', 'C']
    
    # Normalize scores to 0-100 range
    user_normalized = normalize_scores(user_scores)
    career_normalized = normalize_scores(career_profile)
    
    # Calculate weighted differences
    weighted_differences = []
    for dim in dimensions:
        weight = get_dimension_weight(dim, user_scores)
        diff = abs(user_normalized[dim] - career_normalized[dim])
        weighted_differences.append(diff * weight)
    
    # Convert distance to similarity score
    distance = sqrt(sum(d**2 for d in weighted_differences))
    max_distance = sqrt(len(dimensions) * 100**2)
    similarity = (1 - distance / max_distance) * 100
    
    return similarity
